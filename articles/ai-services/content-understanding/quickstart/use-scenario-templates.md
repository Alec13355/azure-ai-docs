# Use Multimodal Intelligence scenario templates in Azure AI Studio


In this article, we show you how to use a Multimodal prebuilt scenario template. Prebuilt scenarios enable you to add intelligence multimodal processing to your apps and workflows without having to train and build your own schemas. For each available prebuilt template, we provide a sample schema and the returned structured output. You can then visualize how Multimodal Intelligence extracts the exact insights you need from your data, no matter the type, content, or modality.

If you prefer to build your own schema to extract specific data from multimodal sources that are aligned to your use cases, *see* [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com/).

Prebuilt scenarios enable you to add content understanding to your apps and workflows without having to train and build your own models and schemas.
