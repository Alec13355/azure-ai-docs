# Azure OpenAI provisioned December 2024 update 

In early-December, 2024, Microsoft launched several changes to the Provisioned offering. These changes include:
    - A new deployment type, Data zone provisioned
    - Updated hourly pricing for Global and Data zone provisioned deployment types
    - New Azure Reservations for Global and Data zone provisioned deployment types

This article is intended for existing users of the provisioned throughput offering. New customers should refer to the [Azure OpenAI provisioned onboarding guide](../how-to/provisioned-throughput-onboarding.md).

## What's changing?

The changes below apply to the Global Provisioned, Data Zone Provisioned, and Provisioned deployment types.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The changes in this article do not apply to the older *"Provisioned Classic (PTU-C)"* offering. They only affect the Provisioned (also known as the Provisioned Managed) offering.

### Data Zone provisioned
Data zone provisioned deployments are available in the same Azure OpenAI resources as all other Azure OpenAI deployment types but allow you to leverage Azure's global infrastructure to dynamically route traffic to the data center within the Microsoft defined data zone with the best availability for each request. Data zone provisioned deployments provide reserved model processing capacity for high and predictable throughput using Azure global infrastructure within the Microsoft defined data zone. Data zone deployments are supported for gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini model families. 

For more information, see the [deployment types guide](https://aka.ms/aoai/docs/deployment-types).

### New hourly pricing for Global and Data Zone provisioned deployments
In August 2024, Microsoft announced that Provisioned deployments would move to a new [hourly payment model](./provisioned-migration.md) with the option to purchase Azure Reservations to support additional discounts. In December's provisioned update, we will be introducing differentiated hourly pricing across Global provisioned, Data zone provisioned, and provisioned deployment types. For more information on the hourly price for each Provisioned deployment type, see the [Pricing details page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/). 

### New Azure Reservations for Globl and Data zone provisioned deployments

## Migrating existing deployments to Global or Data zone provisioned

Existing customers can choose to migrate their existing resources from the Commitment to the Hourly/Reservation payment model to benefit from the ability to deploy the latest models, or to consolidate discounting for diverse deployments under a single reservation.

Two approaches are available for customers to migrate resources using the Commitment model to the Hourly/Reservation model.

### Zero downtime migration 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both self-service approaches generate some additional charges as the payment mode is switched from Committed to Hourly/Reservation.  These are characteristics of the migration approaches and customers aren't credited for these charges.  Customers may choose to use the managed migration approach described below to avoid them.

### Migration with downtime 

The managed migration approach involves the customer partnering with Microsoft to bulk-migrate all the PTU commitments in a subscription/region at the same time. It works like this:

1. The customer will engage their account team and request a managed migration. A migration owner from the Microsoft team will be assigned to assist the customer with migration.
2. A date will be selected when all resources within each of the customers' subscriptions and regions containing current PTU commitments will be migrated from committed to hourly/reservation billing model. Multiple subscriptions and regions can be migrated on the same date.
3. On the agreed-upon date:
    * The customer will purchase regional reservations to cover the committed PTUs that will be converted and pass the reservation information to their Microsoft migration contact.
    * Within 2-3 business days, all commitments will be proactively canceled and deployments previously under commitments will begin using the hourly/reservation payment model.
    * In the billing period after the one with the reservation purchase, the customer will receive a credit for the reservation purchase covering the portions of the commitments that were canceled, starting from the time of the reservation purchase.

Customers must reach out to their account teams to schedule a managed migration.

**Managed migration advantages:**

- Bulk migration of all commitments in an subscription/region is beneficial for customers with many commitments.
- Seamless cost migration: No possibility of double-billing or extra hourly charges.

**Managed migration disadvantages:**

- All commitments in a subscription/region must be migrated at the same time.
- Needing to coordinate a time for migration with the Microsoft team.
