# What is Microsoft Translator Pro (preview)?

Microsoft Translator Pro is a speech-to-speech translation mobile app that enables users to translate conversations across all [supported languages and dialects(TODO)](TODO) [TODO: Available languages listed here(?)](https://www.microsoft.com/translator/languages/) in real time. Translator Pro is designed for enterprises seeking to eliminate language barriers within the workplace by delivering a standalone, native experience within the enterprise ecosystem.

Microsoft Translator Pros is a paid mobile App Service and is supported on both the commercial and government clouds. Enterprise users must create identities and translator resources in either the commercial or government cloud. The app doesn't support hybrid cross-cloud operations (operations across different cloud environments). For example, with this application, you can't use an identity created in the commercial cloud to access your Azure resource in the government cloud.
