1. Sign in to [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com).
1. Studio remembers where you were last, so what you do next depends on where you are:

    * If you are in a project, select **Model catalog** from the left navigation pane.
    * If you have projects but are not in one, select the project you wish to use, then select **Model catalog** from the left navigation pane. Or, you can select **Model catalog and benchmarks** at the bottom of the screen.
    * If you have never used Azure AI Studio before, select **Explore models**.
